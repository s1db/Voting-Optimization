# Voting-Optimization

## Introduction
We attempt to solve multi-objective optimization problems by extending the literature of social choice theory.
We will look at classical problems in the literature and compare voting based approaches to state-of-the-art algorithms.

We model classical problems like Stable Roommates

and compare them to the standard algorithms to solve them.


## Goals
- [ ] Make sure Iterative Copeland is working.
- [ ] Create a wrapper where you only need to provide
